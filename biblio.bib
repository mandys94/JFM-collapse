The theory suggests the possibility that such a cavity may deform to the extent that its wall strikes the solid boundary before minimum cavity volume is reached. High-speed motion pictures of cavities generated by spark methods are used to test the theory experimentally. Agreement between theory and experiment is good for the range of experimental cavities considered, and the phenomenon of the cavity wall striking the solid boundary does indeed occur. Studies of damage by cavities of this type on soft aluminum samples reveals that pressures caused by the cavity wall striking the bounda y are higher than those resulting from a compression of gases inside the cavity, and are responsible for the damage.}",

 abstract = {Our object is to present a broad review of this subject as a branch of hydrodynamics, referring both to the well known `implosion' mechanism first analysed by Lord Rayleigh and, more particularly, to the recently perceived possibility that effects of equally great violence, such as to damage solid boundaries, may arise through the impact of liquid jets formed by collapsing cavities. In §2 a few practical facts about cavitation damage are recalled by way of background, and then in §3 the significance of available theoretical and experimental information about cavity collapse is discussed. The main exposition of new ideas is in §4, which is a review of the factors contributing to shape changes and eventual jet formation by collapsing cavities. Finally, in §5, some new experimental observations on the unsymmetrical collapse of vapour-filled cavities are presented.},
